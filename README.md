# 5LSM0: Neural Networks for Computer Vision

Welcome to the repository for **5LSM0: Neural Networks for Computer Vision**, a course offered by the Department of Electrical Engineering at Eindhoven University of Technology. This course is hosted by the [Video Coding & Architectures research group](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research-groups/signal-processing-systems/video-coding-architectures).

## Overview

This repository contains all the assignments and supplementary materials for the course. The weekly assignments are designed as **Jupyter Notebooks**, providing practical, hands-on experience with the concepts discussed during lectures. These notebooks will help you gain familiarity with implementing neural networks using **PyTorch** in **Python**. For the final assignment, you will apply the knowledge gained throughout the course by coding in native Python and working with a compute cluster, providing valuable experience in real-world computational environments.

### Weekly Assignments

The weekly assignments are structured to guide you through foundational and advanced topics in neural networks for computer vision. These assignments are:
- **Optional**: They are not mandatory but serve as valuable practice to build your coding skills.
- **Hands-On**: Focused on applying theoretical knowledge from the lectures into real-world implementations.

### Final Assignment

The **final assignment** is the cornerstone of this course and accounts for **50% of your final grade**. In this project, you will:
1. Work on a real-world problem using the **CityScapes dataset**.
2. Train neural networks and validate their performance against established baselines.
3. Document your results and insights in a detailed report.

This final assignment requires a deeper dive into the subject, pushing you to apply the knowledge and skills gained throughout the course.
